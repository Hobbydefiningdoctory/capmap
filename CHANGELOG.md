# Changelog

All notable changes to capman are documented here.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-04-05
### Fixed
- Rate limit double-counting on LLM failure — `recordLLMFailure()` no longer increments `llmCallsThisMinute` (slot already reserved by `checkLLMAllowed()`)
- Negative `windowResetIn` in rate limit message — recalculates elapsed after window reset
- Hallucinated capability ID from LLM now correctly returns `out_of_scope` with `confidence: 0` instead of contradictory state
- `null` params no longer written as literal `"null"` into API URLs or nav targets
- Empty string `userId` now correctly injected into session params (was skipped by falsy check)
- `FileCache` and `FileLearningStore` now validate JSON structure before loading — corrupt or unexpected format starts fresh with a warning instead of silently emptying
- `explain()` privacy check now mirrors `resolve()` exactly — unauthenticated admin access correctly reports "requires authentication" not "requires admin role"
- `getFlag()` in CLI now errors clearly when a flag is provided without a value (e.g. `--from` with no path)
- `toSnakeCase()` in parser now strips trailing underscores (e.g. `"__init__"` → `"init"` not `"init_"`)
- Nav param values now URL-encoded in `resolveNav()` — matches API resolver behavior
- Removed dead `paramHints` computation in `extractParams()` — was computed but never used
- `MatchResult` in resolver `No match` test now includes required `candidates: []` field
- `matchWithLLM` correctly imported in matcher tests

### Tests
- 73 tests passing (up from 67)
- Added null param URL tests — API and nav
- Added nav URL encoding test
- Added empty string userId injection test
- Added LLM hallucinated capability ID test
- Added undefined LLM reasoning graceful handling test

## [0.4.3] — 2026-04-03
### Added
- `CapmanEngine.explain(query)` — explains what would match without executing
  - Returns all candidates with per-candidate human-readable explanations
  - Shows `wouldExecute.action` — what API call or nav would happen
  - Shows `wouldExecute.blocked` — if privacy would prevent execution
  - Fully respects rate limiting and circuit breaker (mirrors `ask()` logic)
- `ExplainResult` and `ExplainCandidate` types exported from public API
- `capman explain "query"` CLI command — shows full explanation in terminal
- LLM rate limiting and circuit breaker in `CapmanEngine`
  - `maxLLMCallsPerMinute` — hard rate limit (default: 60)
  - `llmCooldownMs` — minimum ms between consecutive LLM calls (default: 0)
  - `llmCircuitBreakerThreshold` — failures before circuit opens (default: 3)
  - `llmCircuitBreakerResetMs` — ms before circuit resets (default: 60000)
  - `balanced` and `accurate` modes both respect all limits
  - `explain()` shares the same rate limit state as `ask()`

### Fixed
- `explain()` now mirrors `ask()` matching logic exactly — balanced mode escalates to LLM when confidence < threshold
- `matchWithLLM` internal try-catch removed — errors propagate to engine for proper circuit breaker tracking
- Removed `?? []` on required `candidates` field in trace building
- Removed `?.` on `candidates` in CLI `--debug` block
- Fixed mixed indentation in `ask()` switch statement

## [0.4.2] — 2026-02-01
### Added
- `parseOpenAPI(specPathOrUrl)` — parses OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger 2.x specs into capman configs
  - Reads local files or fetches from URL
  - Extracts path params, query params, and request body fields
  - Infers privacy scope from security schemes — bearer → `user_owned`, admin tags → `admin`
  - Generates natural language examples from operation summaries
  - Supports JSON specs; YAML requires `js-yaml` installed
- `capman generate --from <path|url>` — generate manifest from OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- `capman generate --ai` — AI-assisted manifest generation from plain English description
  - Detects `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` automatically
  - Validates generated config with Zod before writing
- `ParseResult` type exported from public API
- 9 new parser tests covering all extraction and inference paths

### Fixed
- `bin/capman.js` `generate` command wrapped in async IIFE for proper async support
- OpenAPI duplicate capability IDs resolved automatically with method suffix

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-03-28
### Fixed
- Prompt injection sanitization in `matchWithLLM` — query now passed as JSON field
- `ask()` now delegates to `CapmanEngine` internally — eliminates logic duplication
- `FileLearningStore` and `MemoryLearningStore` now cap at 10,000 entries with oldest-first pruning
- Post-match cache key now uses `capabilityId + params` instead of raw query — higher hit rate
- Removed duplicate `AskOptions` interface declaration in `index.ts`
- Removed dead imports (`_match`, `_matchWithLLM`, `_resolve`) from `index.ts`
---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-xx
### Added
- `CapmanEngine` class — unified entry point with caching, learning, and tracing
- `ExecutionTrace` — structured trace returned with every `engine.ask()` result
- `MatchCandidate[]` — all scored candidates returned, not just the winner
- `capman run "query" --debug` CLI command — shows all candidate scores
- `capman demo` CLI command — live demo with zero config
- Configurable retries and timeout on API resolver
- `MemoryCache`, `FileCache`, `ComboCache` — pluggable cache backends
- `FileLearningStore`, `MemoryLearningStore` — usage analytics and keyword index
- `MatchMode` — `cheap | balanced | accurate` matching modes

### Fixed
- Optional params no longer get garbage fallback values
- `candidates` field made required (was optional `?`)
- Empty query and LLM paths now correctly set `candidates: []`
- `generate()` now deep-copies capabilities — prevents config mutation
- `MemoryCache` now has 512-entry cap with oldest-first eviction
- `fetchWithRetry` converted from recursive to iterative — no stack overflow risk

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-xx
### Added
- `CapmanEngine` initial design with cache and learning stores
- `FileLearningStore` — persists query history and keyword index
- `ComboCache` — memory-first with file fallback
- `scripts/version.js` — prebuild script keeps `src/version.ts` in sync
- Dual ESM/CJS build verification in CI

### Fixed
- Default stores changed to memory-only — no silent filesystem writes
- `FileCache` and `FileLearningStore` converted to async `fs.promises`
- Shared `computeStats()` helper — eliminates code duplication

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-xx
### Added
- Dual CJS + ESM build (`dist/cjs/` and `dist/esm/`)
- `MatchMode` — `cheap | balanced | accurate`

- POST/PUT/DELETE requests no longer silently dropped
- `extractParams` now extracts real values from queries
- Stopword filtering in scorer
- Zod runtime validation on config and manifest load
- `files` field in `package.json` — clean npm publish

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-xx

- SDK: `match()`, `matchWithLLM()`, `resolve()`, `ask()`
- Two-tier matching: keyword-first, LLM fallback
